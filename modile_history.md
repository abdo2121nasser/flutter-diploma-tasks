## 1. Early Mobile Phones (1970s – 1990s)

### 📞 Hardware Evolution

* **1973**: First handheld mobile phone (Motorola DynaTAC)
* Phones were bulky, expensive, and limited to voice calls
* No operating systems, no applications

### 🧠 Software

* Firmware-based systems
* No user-installed apps

➡️ **Key limitation**: No programmability

---

## 2. Feature Phones Era (1990s – Early 2000s)

### 📱 Popular Devices

* Nokia, Siemens, Sony Ericsson

### 🛠 Software & Apps

* Java ME (J2ME)
* Symbian OS
* Basic apps: Calculator, Snake, SMS, Clock

### ❌ Problems

* Fragmentation
* Limited memory & processing power
* Hard to build cross-device apps

➡️ **Need for smarter phones & better platforms**

---

## 3. Smartphone Revolution (2007 – 2010)

### 🚀 Game Changer

* **2007**: Apple introduces the iPhone
* **2008**: Android OS released by Google

### 🧩 New Capabilities

* Touch screens
* App Stores
* Internet & GPS

### 🧑‍💻 Native Development

| Platform | Language            |
| -------- | ------------------- |
| iOS      | Objective-C / Swift |
| Android  | Java / Kotlin       |

### ❌ Problems

* Separate codebases for each platform
* High development & maintenance cost

➡️ **Demand for cross-platform solutions**

---

## 4. Cross-Platform Development Era (2010 – 2016)

### 🌍 Popular Frameworks

* PhoneGap / Cordova
* Xamarin
* React Native

### ⚙️ How They Worked

* Single codebase
* Bridge to native components

### ❌ Limitations

* Performance overhead
* UI inconsistency
* Platform-specific bugs

➡️ **Developers wanted native performance + single codebase**

---

## 5. Birth of Flutter (2017)

### 🐦 What is Flutter?

Flutter is an **open-source UI SDK** developed by **Google** to build **natively compiled applications** from a **single codebase**.

### 📅 Timeline

* **2017**: Flutter beta
* **2018**: Flutter 1.0 released

### 🧪 Key Innovations

* Dart programming language
* Own rendering engine (Skia)
* No WebView, No JS bridge

---

## 6. Why Flutter Was Different

### 🔥 Core Advantages

* ⚡ High performance (close to native)
* 🎨 Pixel-perfect UI
